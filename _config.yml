  Hello! I am Abhinava, a Computer Science graduate student at UMass Amherst. 
  <br><br>
  I have done multiple internships in the Machine Learning and Deep Learning domains and interesting projects like building a navigation system, a few Hate Speech Detection ones in NLP, recommender systems, etc. I have also worked as a Data Analyst intern at Uber and worked as a graduate research student at the IESL(UMass) for two months contributing to a project that aims to improve compositional generalization in semantic parsing tasks (NLU). I am actively looking for internships (for Summer 2024) where I can work on Data Science and Machine Learning projects. Please reach out if you know of any openings!
